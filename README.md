# Transcendence Modding Experiments
Collection of examples and experiments for Transcendence.
https://transcendence.kronosaur.com/

# Installation:
To install an experiment just copy one of the folders in this package into your Extensions folder in Transcendence. If you don't have an Extensions folder, make one.

The UNIDs are *not unique* across each experiment, they are not meant to install all together. Mostly just for reference and perhaps a starting point for your own experiments.

# Usage

While this package is intended for demonstration you can make use of the code in your own mods freely.
# Packages:
MinViable : A minimum viable adventure extension stripped down to just what is needed to get player into "gamespace"

Lootbox: 2 experiments in alternative ways to grab loot in game without dockscreen interaction.

LargeRandomTopology: A simple setup to explore the random topology generator.

SimpleCombatSandbox: Battlespace to test out weapons and armor quickly.

PlanetInteractionPrototype: Playing with some planets in a star system adding screens for orbit and surface landings to see what it might look like and how it might feel in game to add some art to the planets.
